# Scenario

# You are setting up a new switchboard for your company's phone system. You need to collect everyoneâ€™s current extension numbers and the pin code that they want to use when making calls.

# Because there is no internal phone, you decide to write a bash script to request this information from each of your colleagues, and write it to a csv file to process later.
# Your Task

# Step 1: Firstly you can create a script called get_extensions.

# In this script you will need to ask your user for 4 pieces of information using the read command.

#     What is your first name?:

#     What is your surname/family name?:

#     What is your extension number?:

#     What access code would you like to use when dialing in?:

# You must advise the user that their extension number and access code must both be exactly 4 digits long.

# Note: You should ensure that the extension and pin numbers are exactly 4 digits long. Check out the -N option in the read command documentation, which you can access by running the command help read

read -p "what is your first name?: " firstname
read -p "what is your surname/family name?: " lastname
read -s -N 4 -p "what is your extension number? it must be exactly 4 digits long: " extension
echo
read -s -N 4 -p "what access code would you like to use when dialing in? it must be exactly 4 digits long: " access

# Step 2:

# Using the echo command you then need to save this information to a file called extensions.csv in the following format:

# firstname,lastname,extension,access

# Saving the data like this will make it possible to open the data in Microsoft Excel or some other spreadsheet software for processing (try it out!)
echo $firstname,$lastname,$extension,$access >> extensions.csv
